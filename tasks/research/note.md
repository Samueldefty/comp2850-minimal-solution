# Interview Notes — Week 6

## Participant A
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
**Context**: [e.g., Uses keyboard only, prefers dark mode, has ADHD]
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally
**Duration**: [~10 minutes]

### Q1: Last time you used a task manager
**Response**: "I use Notion for uni work. Last week I had to find all tasks tagged 'COMP2850' to prepare for a deadline. It took ages because the filter kept resetting."

**Observations**:
- Mentioned filter UX issue (cognitive load)
- Time pressure context (deadline stress)
- Tag-based workflow (not just chronological)

**Themes**: `filter_persistence`, `cognitive_load`, `deadline_anxiety`

---

### Q2: What frustrates you?
**Response**: "When I submit a form and nothing happens—like, did it save? I have to refresh the whole page to check."

**Observations**:
- Lack of confirmation feedback
- Low trust in interface
- Workaround = page reload (inefficient)

**Themes**: `status_feedback`, `confirmation`, `trust`

---

### Q3: Lost track of important task?
**Response**: "Yeah, I once forgot to submit coursework because it was buried in my list. I wish there was a way to pin urgent things."

**Observations**:
- List length issue (visibility)
- Prioritisation need
- Consequence = missed deadline (high impact)

**Themes**: `prioritisation`, `visibility`, `urgent_tasks`

---

### Q4: Work without a mouse?
**Response**: "My trackpad broke last month. I tried using Tab to navigate, but some buttons were impossible to reach. Had to borrow a friend's mouse."

**Observations**:
- Keyboard-only experience = friction
- Temporary impairment (broken hardware)
- Exclusion from features

**Themes**: `keyboard_nav`, `temporary_impairment`, `button_accessibility`

---

### Q5: Eyes closed / bright sunlight?
**Response**: "Haven't tried eyes closed, but in sunlight I can't read low-contrast text. I increase zoom but then the layout breaks."

**Observations**:
- Contrast issue (situational disability)
- Zoom breaks responsive design
- Environmental factor (sunlight)

**Themes**: `contrast`, `zoom`, `responsive_design`

---

### Q6: One feature to add?
**Response**: "A way to see progress—like, 'You've completed 8 out of 12 tasks this week.' That would motivate me."

**Observations**:
- Motivation through feedback
- Progress visualisation
- Weekly scope (not just daily)

**Themes**: `progress_tracking`, `motivation`, `feedback`

## Summary (Participant A)
**Top pain points**:
1. Filter resets → cognitive overload
2. No confirmation feedback → uncertainty
3. Keyboard navigation gaps → temporary exclusion
4. Contrast issues in bright light → situational disability

**Job story ideas**:
- "When I'm filtering tasks, I want the selection to persist across page reloads so I don't lose my place."
- "When I submit a form, I want immediate confirmation so I know it worked without refreshing."
- "When my mouse breaks, I want full keyboard access so I can still complete tasks."

**Context**: Computer science student, possibly burnt out, 2nd year, very relaint on computer tools
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally
**Duration**: [~10 minutes]

### Last time you used a task manager?
**Response**: "honestly like earlier today; I rely on one constantly using them for lectures, labs, part-time job and societly events; if i dont write things down theyre gone; it basically prevents my life from collapsing"

**Observations**:
- Time pressure context (deadline stress)
- cognitive overload

**Themes**: 'cognitive_overload', 'deadline_stress'

---

### What frustrates you?
**Response**: "When work piles up and i cant work out whats urgent or when im working on something and i remember about a lab worksheet i havent done; also switching between codespaces from laptop to the uni computers is a pain"

**Observations**: 
- overwhelming work
- unsure what data is needed to be done
- coherent data over codespaces 

**Themes**: 'overwhelming', 'status_of_work'

---

### Lost track of an important task?
**Response**: "Yep; one time i completely forget about a 2860 quiz because it was a folder i wasnt expecting"

**Observations**:

- visibility of files

**Themes**: 'urgent_tasks', 'visibility',

### Work without a mouse?
**Response**: "A lot of the time as when im on campus im using a trackpad but i guess thats a mouse however you lose acuracy; for coding though its mostly key-board driven so the VS code shortcuts are lovely

**Observations**:
- Semi perminent impairment (use of both computer and tackpad)
- reduced accuracy (size of the buttons)
- keyboard experience (short cuts)

**Themes**: 'button_accessability', 'keyboard_shortcuts' 

---

### Eyes Closed / bright sunlight?
**Response**: "bright sunlight is my enemy; trying to debugging outside is impossible its either glare on the screen or the laptop will overheat and die; eyes closed only if im too tired and will just do it with muscle memory

**Observations**:
- enviromental factor (sunlight)
- contrast issue (situational disability)

**Themes**: 'contrast', 'responsive_design'

---

### One feature to add?
**Response**: "nag me mode; if im not doing work or not started a portfolio task it should say to start working on it; not consistently annoying me but enough to get me to start"

**Observations**:

### Last time you used a task manager?

- diy version of them usually

**Themes**: 'complicated', 'persistence'

**Observations**:
- Semi perminent impairment 
- reduced accuracy (size of the buttons)
- lack of speed

**Themes**: 'button_accessability'

---

### Eyes Closed / bright sunlight?
**Response**: bright sunlight might as well be a forcefield my screen becomes a mirror; half my uni life is me hunting for a seat where the sun isnt directly obliterating my laptop. eyes closed only when im trying to recall a theory or avoiding reading another dense article

**Observations**:
- contrast issues (situational disability)
- enviromental factors (sunlight)

**Themes**: 'contrast', 'responsive_design'

---

### One feature to add?
**Response**: maybe something that auto-sorts task by how long theyll actually take instead of me prestendng every assigment is an hour job; or something that syncs due to dates straight from minerva so i stop missing things that hide in folders

**Observations**:
- estimater from previous data
- organiser 

**Themes**: 'progress_tracking', 'estimator'
